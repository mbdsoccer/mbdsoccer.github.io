<p>Here we can see one of the most well known waffles, and just so happens to be
my favorite, the coveted blueberry waffle. It is disctincted by either 
blueberrys baked in, blueberrys on top, or by blueberry syrup. It is
commonly known to appear at breakfeast time or at waffle house.</p>
<h3><b>The Strawberry Waffle</b></h3>

<p>Even though the strawberry could be baked into the waffle with flavoring,
strawberrys are a great waffle topping that go with most other waffles.
They can be used to make your waffle more appealing to the eye or if
your just in the mood to feel like royalty.</p>
<h3><b>The Chocolate Chip Waffle</b></h3>

<p>Like other waffles we have gone over, the chocolate can either be
bake in or sprinkled in on top. If you dont have a plain waffle
it will most likely be chocolate chip. The chips add a richness
to the waffle that you cant get from adding fruit. And the taste will
change completely depending on what type of chocolate you use.</p>

<h3><b>The OG Waffle</b></h3>

<p>This is the very first original waffle. Its is like your canvas 
waiting for it to be turned into a perfect masterpiece. 
This waffle is not limited to its base, it will be cultivated 
in many ways by many people until it ascends to a higher
state of perfection.</p>
<h3><b>The Toppings</b></h3>
<p>This is your paint platter for your canvas of waffle, you are 
the brust that turns copy paper into Starry Night. Your colors are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chocolate Syrup</li>
  <li>Blueberry Syrup</li>
  <li>Strawberry Syrup</li>
  <li>Whipped Cream</li>
  <li>Strawberrys</li>
  <li>Ice cream</li>
  <li>And possibly whatever you want, because you are not
  limited to the colors you are given, because you can mix them in 
  order to make new ones.</li>
</ul>
